  ## Description
  Reddit is an extremely popular social media platform known for its 'subreddits' that function as individual forums around specific topics. We wanted to do our best to clone some of its functionality, in what we call 'Re-Reddit.'

    ```md
    AS someone looking to use Re-Reddit
    I WANT the ablility to create an account and log-in
    SO THAT a device isn't limited to just a single user
	I WANT to be able to expand posts
	SO THAT I can see them better
    I WANT to be able create posts
	SO THAT I can contribute to the platform
    ```

  For this project, we utilized the following technologies:
  - React, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose

  Future plans for enhancement:
  - Add in ability to comment
  - Add in ability to upvote and downvote
  - Add in ability to create additional sub-re-reddits
